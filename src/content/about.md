With 6 years of dedicated web development experience, I've had the privilege of serving a variety of users and business needs. I love crafting delightful and intuitive web interfaces, which drives me to excel in delivering user-facing solutions.

In my most recent role as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://corp.voxmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Vox Media</a>, I played a key role in improving editorial workflows by contributing to a proprietary CMS that powers renowned sites like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Vox</a>. As a core member of the Editorial Tools team, I focused on building publishing and content management tools for journalists.

My journey also includes roles as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.beatport.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Beatport</a>, the global hub of electronic music, and at <a href="https://havenly.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Havenly</a>, a dynamic interior design and e-commerce startup. Prior to my tech career, I developed valuable leadership and communication skills during my time as a program manager in higher education.

Based in Denver, I share my life with my husband and energetic toddler son. Beyond my family and career, my interests include fitness and the occasional nature hike.
