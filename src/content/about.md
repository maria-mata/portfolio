I have been building web applications for the past 6 years. Most recently, I was a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://corp.voxmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Vox Media</a> where I worked on a proprietary CMS that powers hundreds of editorial sites, such as The Verge, Vox, and Eater. As a member of the Editorial Tools team, I developed features to support publishing and content management workflows used by journalists.

Before that, I was a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.beatport.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Beatport</a>, the world-wide home of electronic music, and <a href="https://havenly.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Havenly</a> â€” an interior design and e-commerce startup. Prior working in tech, I was a program manager in higher education for many years.

I live in Denver, CO with my spouse and energetic toddler son. Outside of my family and career, I like to spend my free time working out and being out in nature.
